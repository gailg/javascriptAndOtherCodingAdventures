                <h2>Finding simplicity in life </h2>
                <p>Life can get complicated really quickly, but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways 
                    to simplify your life, a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking 
                    a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already living.

                        <h2>Keeping cooking simple</h2>
                        <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have 
                            to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and 
                            simple.

                        <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
                        <p> Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their 
                            relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as 
                            simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.

                        <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
                        <p> A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't 
                            decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were 
                            hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to 
                            and make things pop like never before.
