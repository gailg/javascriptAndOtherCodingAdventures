                <p class="article-body"><strong>This animated gif was created in Photoshop.</strong>     I began by creating a 
                    collection of collage materials.  Some textures I started with scanned images of pencil 
                    or watercolor or inks on paper.  Others I created using

                        Kyle Webster brushes</a>.
                    I make use of Photoshop's blend modes and adjustment layers to push variety in my 
                    collage materials.  I also use Photoshop's (and Illustrator's) pattern tool.

                        A long time ago, I filled up my garage with inks and acrylics and tempera paints
                        and lots and lots of things that helped me manipulate paint into textures.  
                        I was inspired by <a href="http://masterfield.net/">Maxine Masterfield's</a>
                        two books <em>Painting the Spirit of Nature</em> and <em>In Harmony with Nature</em>.
                        Maxine showed what can be possible by allowing ink to dry under and around things
                        like leaves, shells, wax paper, plastic wrap, and wax.

                        When I made collage materials (pourings) traditionally, I hoarded them.  It was very hard to 
                        cut into one-of-a-kind pieces.  And then there were many that were almost perfect,
                        but not, or not big enough, or the wrong color.  When you scan these mistakes into
                        Photoshop, they can be fixed or manipulated or even turned into repeatable seamless patterns.
                        And you can use them over and over again.

                        Kyle Webster brushes</a> to help me make textures from scratch.  And I can combine different
                        textures using blend modes to get increasingly complex textures. There is so much to
                        explore and learn.

                        <a href="https://www.carlasonheim.com/">Carla Sonheim</a> gives the following exercise:
                        Close your eyes and cut out a shape.  Now do something with the shape.  Instead of paper
                        and scissors, I used the Photoshop's lasso tool to cut out a shape and then turned it into
                        a mask.  Then I tried out the mask on different collage materials. I've always enjoyed 
                        collage because you can move around shapes and colors and textures and discover what works.
                        Adding the freedoms that Photoshop gives opens up even more possibilities.
